Project context: Quantara quantitative prediction system at /sim/prediction/quantara. Working directory established with playground/ subdirectory for experimental scripts. User analyzing stock 001309 (Wandekai/万得凯) with 100-day historical data via DataGetter interface (dual-source: local xtdata priority, fallback to MCP proxy at data.cpolar.top). Technical stack confirmed: matplotlib, TA-Lib, pandas, numpy/scipy for spectral analysis. Current analytical phase: Phase 1 spectral analysis (FFT periodogram, Welch's method, ACF/PACF) confirmed for implementation 2026-02-14; planned deliverable is playground/spectrum_phase1_analysis.py producing PSD comparison plots (Periodogram vs Welch), ACF/PACF charts, and Fisher significance tests for cyclicality detection in price and volume series. Critical constraint: all experimental code must be confined to playground/ subdirectory; modifications to other directories prohibited. Analytical interest: spectral analysis, frequency domain decomposition, volume/price cyclicality detection, non-stationary time series processing. Methodology review previously completed. Personal context: User parent of 6-month-old infant (baby care guide for 0-6 months completed 2026-02-13).
