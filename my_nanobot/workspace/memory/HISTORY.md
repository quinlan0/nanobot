[2026-02-13 09:22] User transitioned from technical indicator analysis to spectral analysis request for stock 001309. After successfully plotting price/volume with TA-Lib indicators (MA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands), user now seeks professional frequency-domain analysis methods to detect periodicity and cyclical patterns in both price and volume time series. Requested theoretical methodology review before implementation in the /sim/prediction/quantara/playground environment.

[2026-02-13 09:42] User initiated Phase 1 spectral analysis implementation for stock 001309 (Wandekai/万得凯) following the comprehensive methodology review. Requested FFT periodogram, Welch method, and ACF/PACF analysis with visualization outputs for the 100-day historical dataset. Imposed strict directory constraint: all code must remain confined to playground/ subdirectory with no modifications to other project directories.

[2026-02-13 18:28] User confirmed initiation of Phase 1 spectral analysis for stock 001309, requesting FFT periodogram, Welch's method, and ACF/PACF with visualization outputs, strictly confined to playground/ directory. Assistant executed code generation and implementation via write_file and exec tools. User subsequently queried existing notes inventory at 18:28.

[2026-02-14 12:15] User provided audio response following assistant's status review identifying Phase 1 spectral analysis as the primary pending quantitative task. Assistant had clarified that FFT periodogram, Welch's method, and ACF/PACF analysis for stock 001309 was requested but not yet delivered, presenting three workflow options with recommendation to prioritize Phase 1 implementation. Proposed deliverables include playground/spectrum_phase1_analysis.py generating power spectral density comparisons, autocorrelation charts, and Fisher-tested dominant period detection. User's audio input confirms direction to proceed with the spectral analysis implementation.
